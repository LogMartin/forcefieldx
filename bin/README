Force Field X uses the following wrappers around native libraries:
1) JOCL for OpenCL (depends on Gluegen)
2) JOGL for OpenGL (depends on Gluegen
3) JCUDA for CUDA v. 5.0 (build 35) 

The native 64-bit binaries for JCUDA are in the directory "64-bit" for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows 64-bit binaries. The other native libraries are handled via the Maven repository.
