Force Field X uses the following wrappers around native libraries:
1) JOCL for OpenCL and JOGL for OpenGL, which depend on Gluegen and are all found in jogamp-fat.jar
2) JCUDA for CUDA v. 6.5.14

The native 64-bit binaries for JCUDA are in the directory "64-bit" for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows 64-bit binaries.
The other native libraries are handled via the Maven repository.
