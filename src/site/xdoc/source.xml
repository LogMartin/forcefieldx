            <p>The Force Field X project is hosted at
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kenai.com/projects/ffx/">Kenai</a> with the source code in a GIT repository.
                "
                <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from
                small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."
                To clone the Force Field X source using GIT:
                <source>git clone git://kenai.com/ffx~public-source ffx</source>
            </p>
            <p>In the future, your clone of Force Field X can be updated to the latest version using the command:
                <source>git pull origin master</source>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Build FFX">
            <p>A Maven project file (pom.xml) is provided to build Force Field X on any platform. After cloing the Force Field X git repository, change
                directoies into the base project directory. Then execute:
                <source>mvn deploy</source>
                This requires Maven v. 3.2 or later to be installed with its bin directory included in your $PATH environment variable. The first time this command
                is executed, Maven will download build dependencies and Force Field X runtime dependecies. Future executions are quicker. Force Field X will self-test
                its modules and report failures. Only code that passes all testing should be uploaded to the Kenai repository, so if any test fails it may be
                due to a local configuration issue. To skip the tests:
                <source>mvn -DskipTests deploy</source>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the build succeeds, Force Field X can be executed using platform dependent start-up scripts located in the bin.
                On Mac OS X or Linux:
                <source>bin/ffxc energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
                On Windows:
                <source>bin/ffxc.bat energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
                The ffx/bin directory should be appended to your $PATH environment variable. The "energy" command
                refers to an internal version of the energy.ffx script that can be found in the ffx/scripts
                directory. To embed your own script within FFX, place it into the scripts directory and
                rebuild FFX.

            <p>Maven is like "make", but more powerful due to the platform independence of the Jave Runtime Environment. Maven is used to manage the dependencies of Force Field X, compile it, test it, document it and then put everything together into the website.
