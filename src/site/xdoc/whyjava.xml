            <p>"Why Java?", in our opinion, is perhaps not the right question. Instead, let's ask "Why the JRE?",
                or Java Runtime Environment. The only answer that matters is that we can get more science done,
                where we refers the developers of Force Field X and to the scientific community in general.
            </p>
            <p>The reasons the JRE is superior to compiled languages for getting science done, when compared to
                langauges like FORTRAN or C/C++ that must be compiled to binary formats before they are disseminated,
                are the subject of this page.
