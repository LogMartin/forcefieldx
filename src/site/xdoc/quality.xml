      <p>An important part of the software development process is quality assurance. In our case, JUnit, the standard Java testing framework, is being used to build up a comprehensive suite of tests. An added benefit of regression testing is a useful performance benchmark.</p>
      <p>"JUnit is a regression testing framework written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck. It is used by the developer who implements unit tests in Java." More information is available at the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit Website.</a></p>
      <p>Long story short, if you have Force Field X code that implements an algorithm you would like us to include in the distribution, you might consider implementing appropriate JUnit tests so we can avoid regressions down the road.</p>
      <p>Current JUnit test results are available <a href="surefire-report.html">here.</a></p>
