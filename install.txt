On Mac OS X add the ffx/bin/macosx directory to your path. For example, if ffx is unpacked into /Users/shared/ffx
BASH
export PATH="/Users/shared/ffx/bin/macosx:$PATH"
CSH
setenv PATH "/Users/shared/ffx/bin/macosx:$PATH"


On Linux add the ffx/bin/linux directory to your path. For example, if ffx is unpacked into /Users/shared/ffx
