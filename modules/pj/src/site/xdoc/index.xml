            <p>Parallel Java (PJ) is an API and middleware for parallel programming in 100% Java
                on shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) parallel computers, cluster parallel computers,
                and hybrid SMP cluster parallel computers. PJ was developed by Professor Alan Kaminsky
                and his student Luke McOmber in the Department of Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
