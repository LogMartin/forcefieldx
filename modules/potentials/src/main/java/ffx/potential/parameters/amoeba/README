4.) AMOEBA Nucleic Acid References

amoebanuc09.prm is a beta version of AMOEBA nucleic acid parameters as
developed by Chuanjie Wu, Ponder Lab, Washington University, May 2008

5.) Notes on the Force Field X implementation of AMOEBA

The file "AMOEBA-BASE" contains properties that are common between the AMOEBA
parameter files. Since the Force Field X potential implements only AMOEBA,
these properties are set by default and not parsed. Further notes on individual
force field terms are given below.

These BondType parameters are declared as final fields:

bond-cubic              -2.55
bond-quartic            3.793125

These AngleType parameters are declared as final fields:

angle-cubic             -0.014
angle-quartic           0.000056
angle-pentic            -0.0000007
angle-sextic            0.000000022

The Allinger style OutOfPlaneBendType parameters are declared as final fields.
Other styles are not implemented.

opbend-cubic            -0.014
opbend-quartic          0.000056
opbend-pentic           -0.0000007
opbend-sextic           0.000000022
opbendtype              ALLINGER

This TorsionType conversion factor is declared as a final field:

torsionunit             0.5

Only the BUFFERED-14-7 VDWType is currently supported by FFX and respects
the CUBIC-MEAN and HHG radius and epsilon combining rules, respectively. The
masking rules are hard-coded into VanDerWaals class for efficiency; such that
the vdw-*-scale keywords are supported.

vdwtype                 BUFFERED-14-7
radiusrule              CUBIC-MEAN
radiustype              R-MIN
radiussize              DIAMETER
epsilonrule             HHG
vdw-13-scale            0.0
vdw-14-scale            1.0
vdw-15-scale            1.0

The AMOEBA electrostatics are hard-coded to use a dielectric constant of 1.0.
Values other than 1.0 are of limited physical signficance since AMOEBA takes
into account polarization explicitly. Mutual polarization is the default.

dielectric              1.0
polarization            MUTUAL

Only non-unity masking rules are respected for efficiency, but at the cost of
reduced flexibility relative to the original TINKER code. The following scale 
factors are implemented:

mpole-12-scale          0.0
mpole-13-scale          0.0
mpole-14-scale          0.4
mpole-15-scale          0.8

direct-11-scale         0.0

polar-12-scale          0.0
polar-13-scale          0.0

These scale factors are currently hard-coded to be 1.0:

polar-14-scale          1.0
polar-15-scale          1.0

direct-12-scale         1.0
direct-13-scale         1.0
direct-14-scale         1.0

mutual-11-scale         1.0
mutual-12-scale         1.0
mutual-13-scale         1.0
mutual-14-scale         1.0
